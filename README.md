# Bumble_app_review_topic_analysis_with_BERTopic

Using BERTopic to identify common themes in Bumble app reviews


- This analysis uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique called topic modelling to understand which topics frequently occur for Bumble app reviews on the Google Play Store


- The data cover the period 2015-2022 and consist of circa 105,000 reviews


- A BERTopic model identified 100 potential topics which were narrowed down into 30 actionable topics in this analysis


- The analysis showed that although the highest ranked topic gave a positive view of Bumble, this was outweighed by many smaller topics which emphasised customer pain points


- Topics such as verification and sign-in issues, account blocking and issues with app loading were prevalent among many app users


- Bumble should take this opportunity to focus on these issues, address the concerns of users and ultimately improve the experience on its app
